/*
 * Why I chose not to let the user choose their own range:
 * People are annoying and they often make sumb decisions. Someone could choose
 * an extrenely large range
 * making it next to impossible to guess. The user would thn get fustrated that
 * they can not guess the
 * number and stop playing the game. Choosing 1 -100 makes it so that the user
 * can guess the number but also
 * gives the user a bit of a challange. It is the perfect range !!
